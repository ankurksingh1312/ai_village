AI Village is a futuristic, open-source community where AI and machines handle farming, energy, healthcare, and daily needs, blending city comforts with nature. Humans are free to pursue passions, explore consciousness, and live truly liberated lives.

A 10-Year Open-Source Vision
AI Village is a groundbreaking, open-source project spanning a decade, designed to create a self-sustaining community where humans and AI work together to build and manage a harmonious living environment. This visionary village offers the comforts of a modern city while preserving the natural beauty and tranquility of rural life.

In AI Village, essential activities such as farming, energy production, cooking, housing, healthcare, and waste management are fully automated and efficiently managed by AI and machines. This allows humans to be free from conventional jobs, giving them the opportunity to pursue their passions, engage in meditation, play sports, explore scientific discoveries, deepen their understanding of consciousness, and even learn ancient techniques like Black Magic.
